Thor extensions for easier work with shell colors, filelists from Rake and bindings to Merb.

h1. Usage

h2. General

Just require thor-utils and you can use sh, ruby, thor, rake methods in subclasses of Thor class, you can use colors from Term::ANSIColor directly (blue "foo") and you can also use FileList from Rake.

<pre>
require "thor-utils"
require "thor-utils/merb"

class MyTasks < Thor
  # use start_environment method
end
</pre>
